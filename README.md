🧳 Campus Lost & Found

A simple and practical Lost & Found web application built for college campuses.
Students can report lost or found items, and an admin can review and approve listings before they are publicly visible.

🔗 Live Demo:
https://lost-and-found-crgt.onrender.com/

⚠️ Note: The first load may take 30–60 seconds because the app is hosted on a free Render instance that sleeps during inactivity.

🎯 Problem Statement

In college campuses, lost items are usually reported via informal WhatsApp groups or word of mouth, which is inefficient and unorganized.
This project provides a centralized digital platform where students can report and discover lost or found items in a structured way.

✅ Features
Student Side

View approved lost & found items

Report a lost or found item using a simple form

No login required (kept simple for accessibility)

Admin Side

Admin-only approval workflow

Approve or reject reported items

Control what appears publicly

⚙️ How the App Works (High Level)

Flask app starts using an application factory (create_app)

Database schema is initialized automatically using:

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS

Users submit lost/found items

Items remain hidden until approved by admin

Approved items appear on the public homepage

This approach makes the app portable across environments without manual database setup.

🧪 Database Initialization (Important)

The database schema is created automatically on startup:

No manual SQL execution required

Safe to run multiple times

Prevents no such table errors on deployment

This is handled inside the app factory using app.app_context().

🚀 Running Locally
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/maverick5090/Lost-and-Found.git
cd Lost-and-Found
2️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Run the app
python run.py

The app will be available at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000
☁️ Deployment Notes (Render)

Hosted on Render Free Tier

App may take time to wake up after inactivity

SQLite data may reset on redeploy or instance restart

For production use, SQLite can be replaced with PostgreSQL for persistent storage.

🔐 Admin Access

Admin approval logic is implemented on the backend

Authentication is intentionally kept simple for college demo use

Can be extended with proper login/auth in future versions

📌 Limitations

No user authentication (by design)

SQLite is not suitable for high-scale production

Free hosting causes cold-start delays

📈 Future Improvements

User authentication (student login)

Persistent database (PostgreSQL)

Image uploads with moderation

Search and category filters

Email or notification system

🎓 Academic Note

This project is built as a college-level full-stack web application to demonstrate:

Backend development with Flask

Proper deployment practices

Debugging real production issues

Clean project structure
